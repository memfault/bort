# Bort: Memfault SDK for AOSP

The purpose of the Bort SDK is to make it really easy to collect detailed
diagnostics from your entire Android device, from low-level or hardware issues
to high-level application crashes, and upload them automatically to Memfault.

See the [Memfault Android Documentation](https://mflt.io/android) for more
information.

This branch of the SDK only supports Android versions 8-10. For Android 11+
support, use the [master branch](https://github.com/memfault/bort/tree/master).
