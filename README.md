# Bort: Memfault SDK for AOSP

The purpose of the Android SDK is to make it really easy to collect detailed
diagnostics from your entire Android device, from low-level or hardware issues
to high-level application crashes, and upload them automatically to Memfault.

See the [Memfault Android Documentation](https://mflt.io/android) for more
information.

This branch of the SDK only supports Android versions 11 and above. For Android
8-10 support, use the [8-10 branch](https://github.com/memfault/bort/tree/8-10).
